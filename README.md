# Bookstore Management System
The project is built to help an employee. There is a sign-up function where the
employee first registers themselves and their ID, name, and password are stored
in a file. There is a sign-in function where the employee enters the required
details to enter the main menu of the bookstore. Here, they have the option to
sell, add, edit, delete, view list of available books and view list of books sold.
